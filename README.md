Installing _geopandas_ may be necessary.

> _conda install --channel conda-forge geopandas_

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb data to understand the correlation between prices and review scores:

1. Does one good category review means all categories have good reviews or vice versa?
2. How are Airbnbs distributed over Seattle according to price
3. Does higher prices mean better user experience

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is only one notebook for analysis that compile all the plots and observations needed to answer the questions above

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).
